# GPS-and-GNSS
These projects are for my master's course, which are as follows:
  ## P1 :
  Carrier Smoothing of Code Pseudoranges, which has various methods such as:
  Normal Hatch algorithm, Divergence Effect Free Hatch algorithm And the Ionosphere Free Hatch algorithm is done.
  ## P2 :
  Carrier Phase Cycle-Slip Detection which in ways like Geometry-free combination And Blewitt is done.
  ## P3
  Computation of GNSS Satellite Coordinates
  Since satellites have their specefic coordinate system(CRS) and users are intersted in using fix
  coordiante(TRS) that is why demanding algorithm to trnsport from ECI to ECEF in geodesy.
  ## P4
  Computation of the Emission Time and Computation of Satellite Coordinates
  the two Computation of the Emission Time and Computation of Satellite Coordinates are done.
  ## P5
  Atmospheric Effects Modelling
  Fermat’s principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the link between ray optics
  and wave optics and ...
  ## P6
  Bancroft Method
  If we want to be able obtain primitve receiver’s position without priori knowledge, one of the
  solutions is Bancroft method.
  ## P7
  Computation of station coordinate
